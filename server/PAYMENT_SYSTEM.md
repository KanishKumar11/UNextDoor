## Backend Implementation

### Models

#### 1. Subscription Model (`server/src/models/Subscription.js`)
- Manages user subscriptions, plan features, and billing cycles
- Supports proration calculations and upgrade history
- Tracks subscription status and cancellation reasons

#### 2. PaymentTransaction Model (`server/src/models/PaymentTransaction.js`)
- Comprehensive transaction logging and audit trail
- Supports refunds, proration credits, and dispute tracking
- Links transactions to subscriptions for complete history

### Services

#### 1. Payment Gateway Interface (`server/src/services/payment/interfaces/IPaymentGateway.js`)
- Abstract interface following SOLID principles
- Enables easy integration of multiple payment gateways
- Standardized methods for all payment operations

#### 2. Razorpay Gateway (`server/src/services/payment/gateways/RazorpayGateway.js`)
- Complete Razorpay integration with all required methods
- Handles orders, payments, subscriptions, refunds, and webhooks
- Implements signature verification for security

#### 3. Feature Gating Service (`server/src/services/featureGatingService.js`)
- Manages subscription-based feature access
- Handles "coming soon" features consistently
- Provides upgrade suggestions based on desired features

#### 4. Lesson Usage Service (`server/src/services/lessonUsageService.js`)
- Tracks lesson consumption per subscription period
- Enforces usage limits based on subscription tier
- Provides usage analytics and reporting

### Controllers

#### 1. Subscription Controller (`server/src/controllers/subscriptionController.js`)
- Handles subscription creation, upgrades, and cancellation
- Implements prorated upgrade logic
- Manages payment verification and activation

#### 2. Payment Webhook Controller (`server/src/controllers/paymentWebhookController.js`)
- Secure webhook processing with signature verification
- Handles all Razorpay webhook events
- Manages subscription state changes and notifications

#### 3. Feature Controller (`server/src/controllers/featureController.js`)
- Provides feature access information to frontend
- Returns upgrade options and pricing comparisons
- Manages "coming soon" feature listings

### Middleware

#### 1. Feature Gating Middleware (`server/src/middleware/featureGatingMiddleware.js`)
- Protects routes based on subscription tier
- Checks usage limits before allowing access
- Provides detailed access denied responses with upgrade suggestions

### API Routes

#### Subscription Routes (`/api/v1/subscriptions/`)
- `GET /plans` - Get available subscription plans
- `GET /current` - Get user's current subscription
- `POST /create-order` - Create payment order
- `POST /verify-payment` - Verify and activate subscription
- `GET /upgrade-preview/:planId` - Calculate upgrade costs
- `POST /cancel` - Cancel subscription at period end
- `POST /reactivate` - Reactivate cancelled subscription

#### Feature Routes (`/api/v1/features/`)
- `GET /user` - Get user's feature access and limits
- `GET /check/:feature` - Check specific feature access
- `GET /lessons/usage` - Get lesson usage statistics
- `GET /upgrade-options` - Get available upgrade plans
- `GET /comparison` - Get feature comparison table
- `GET /coming-soon` - Get coming soon features

#### Webhook Routes (`/api/v1/webhooks/`)
- `POST /razorpay` - Handle Razorpay webhooks
- `GET /logs` - Get webhook processing logs (admin)

## Upgrade Policy Implementation

### Prorated Upgrade System
1. **Immediate Feature Unlock**: User gets upgraded features right away
2. **Billing Cycle Change**: User's billing cycle changes to the new plan immediately
3. **Credit Calculation**: Unused portion of current plan is credited
4. **No Day Carryover**: Only monetary value is credited, not time periods

### Example Calculation
```javascript
// User on Basic Monthly (â‚¹149), 10 days left, upgrades to Standard Quarterly (â‚¹399)
const dailyRate = 149 / 30; // â‚¹4.97 per day
const unusedDays = 10;
const credit = unusedDays * dailyRate; // â‚¹49.70
const amountToPay = 399 - 49.70; // â‚¹349.30
```

### Implementation Rules
- **Upgrades Only**: Mid-cycle downgrades are not allowed
- **Immediate Access**: New features are unlocked instantly
- **Fair Pricing**: Users only pay the difference
- **Simple Renewals**: Next renewal is at full price of new plan

## Feature Gating Implementation

### Access Control Levels
1. **Free Tier**: No lesson access, coming soon features disabled
2. **Basic Tier**: 10 lessons/month, limited community access
3. **Standard Tier**: 10 lessons/month, full community, priority support
4. **Pro Tier**: 10 lessons/month, premium features, live chat support

### Coming Soon Features
Features marked as "coming soon" across all tiers:
- Live 1-on-1 Tutoring
- Group Classes
- Mobile App
- Offline Mode
- Speech Recognition
- AI Conversation Partner
- Custom Study Plans
- Advanced Analytics
- Peer Matching
- Cultural Content

### Usage Tracking
- Lesson consumption tracked per billing period
- Prevents access when limits are reached
- Provides upgrade prompts with clear benefits
- Historical usage analytics for optimization

## Security Implementation

### Payment Security
- **Server-side Validation**: All payment processing on backend
- **Signature Verification**: Webhook signature validation
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **No Client Secrets**: Payment keys never exposed to frontend
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history logging

### Feature Security
- **Backend Enforcement**: Feature gating enforced server-side
- **Token Validation**: JWT-based authentication for all endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of payment endpoints
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Razorpay Configuration
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your-key-id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your-secret-key
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret

# Feature Flags

ENABLE_FEATURE_GATING=true
ENABLE_PRORATION=true

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
